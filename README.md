# Fashion-Zone

  Shopping has become an indispensable part of everyone's life. Most people prefer online shopping because it is easy, safe, and much more convenient. The fashion site that will be created aims to meet the requirements of customers by providing them with the opportunity to register, purchase, and view new or specific products.
  The system will be developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js as front-end, and Node.js + express as backend technologies. Each view will have a distinct URL, and the routing between pages will be done client side using React Router. The backend will be implemented as a REST/JSON API using JSON data serialization.


# Setup:

For Client side:
 * to install all dependency run - npm install
 * to start the application run - npm start
 
For server side:
 * to install all dependency run - npm install
 * to start the application run - npx nodemon
